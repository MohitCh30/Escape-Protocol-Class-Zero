## 📖 **Project Background**

This game was originally created as part of the Aicade Game Developer Internship Task.

The assignment required us to:

Start with an AI-generated base game.

Manually rewrite at least 70% of the code.

Enhance both gameplay mechanics and visual presentation.

I didn’t want to just submit to complete the task. My goal was to build a branching, choice-driven experience with:

Player morality systems.

Narrative choices leading to multiple endings.

Polished transitions, visuals, and audio.

## ✨ **Features & Enhancements**

70%+ of AI code rewritten (major refactor & new mechanics).

Morality system affecting story flow.

Three different endings based on player choices.

Scene transitions and smoother flow.

Audio integration for immersion.

## 🛠️ **Struggles & Learning Journey**

This wasn’t an easy ride:

Persistent black screen & scroll bugs blocked progress for hours.

Debugging at scale was harder than expected on Aicade’s platform.

I almost gave up, even messaged the organizers about it. But instead of quitting, I iterated, rebuilt, and pushed through.

This repo represents that growth and persistence more than just the final game.

## 👤**Author’s Note**

This project is not yet at the level I originally envisioned. I had hoped to build a far more immersive, interactive experience — with deeper mechanics, branching dialogue, and a more polished narrative.

That said, Escape Protocol: Class Zero reflects both my best effort within the constraints and my growth as a developer during the process. It represents persistence through setbacks and the determination to deliver something playable, even when I was close to giving up.

I see this not as a finished product, but as a starting point for future learning and improvement in game development.
